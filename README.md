# The Equipment Box (Monster Hunter Rise Set Builder)
A small website for a monster hunter build creator/viewer based on JSON files.

Right now, it only can view properly written JSON files.

Originally a small school project, I'mma try to get this properly working.
Credit to: MHRice Info site for the data ripped from MH:Rise/Sunbreak.

Features:
* Built with React to offer a smooth and user-friendly app interface for both mobile and desktop.
* Can select armor from all of the base game armors (sunbreak armors will be added soon)
* Select weapons (Charge Blade Only, for now) from a variety of different weapons, and see their stats
* The stats page gives a combination of all the stats you will have with the selected equipment, 
  including proper damage modified for sharpness levels.

##### TODO:
* Write detailed tooltips for stats and weapons.
* Add support for Sunbreak armors, - INCOMPLETE - WIP
    - Maybe even have a Sunbreak-Iceborne mode swapping - After finishing sunbreak support
* Support for more weapons
* Implementation of more game mechanics, such as:
  - Skills
  - Weapon types other than Charge Blade
  - Talismans
  - Sunbreak armors
    * Also Qurio armor, weapon, and talisman support
