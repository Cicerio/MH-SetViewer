# MH-SetViewer
A small website for a monster hunter build viewer based on JSON files.

Right now, it only can view properly written JSON files.

Originally a small school project, I'mma try to get this properly working.

Features:
* Rewritten in React - Now can modularize webpages, and can focus on making others.

TODO:

* Write a boilerplate JSON file

* Maybe add a set creator, requiring a database of armors 
* Add support for Sunbreak armors, 
    Maybe even have a Sunbreak-Iceborne mode swapping
* Mobile-first UI, RESPONSIVE ui
    rework the right column  
    do proper sharpness values (learn how they work)

    Have an icon swapper (World-Rise)
